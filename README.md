# AI Agent Form - Copilot Assignment

A Next.js application with a form for collecting AI agent ideas. Your task is to implement the AI copilot functionality.

## Assignment

**Objective**: Implement an AI copilot that appears on the right side of the form and helps users fill the form.

## Current State

- ✅ Form component with name, email, LinkedIn, and idea fields
- ✅ Responsive layout with dedicated copilot space
- ✅ **TODO**: Implement the AI copilot component

## Sample Conversation

Here's how the copilot should guide users through filling the form:

**Copilot**: Hi! I'm here to help you submit your AI agent idea. Let's start with the basics - what's your name?

**User**: My name is Priya Sharma

**Copilot**: Nice to meet you, Priya! 🎯 _[Updates Name field: "Priya Sharma"]_

Let me get your email address so we can reach out to you about your idea.

**User**: priya.sharma@email.com

**Copilot**: Perfect! 🎯 _[Updates Email field: "priya.sharma@email.com"]_

Now, could you share your LinkedIn profile URL? This helps us understand your background better.

**User**: https://linkedin.com/in/priya-sharma

**Copilot**: Great! 🎯 _[Updates LinkedIn field: "https://linkedin.com/in/priya-sharma"]_

Now for the exciting part - tell me about the AI agent you'd like to build. What problem would it solve?

**User**: I want to create an AI agent that helps developers automatically generate unit tests for their code

**Copilot**: That's a fantastic idea! An AI agent for automated unit test generation would be really valuable for developers. 🎯 _[Updates Idea field: "I want to create an AI agent that helps developers automatically generate unit tests for their code"]_

Perfect! I've filled out all your information. You can review everything in the form and submit when you're ready. Is there anything you'd like to modify?
